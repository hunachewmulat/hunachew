Vacations are the best time to relax and enjoy and I eagerly wait for my summer vacations every year.
 Every year my Universty closes in the middle of the month and at the end of the year of June and the
Annual exams get over and the results are declared.



This time I got promoted to semester pass any year pass. After the hard labor for the examinations, I wanted some rest and also some refreshment. 
Hence I put aside my books for a few .at the next weeks of summber morning I went out to play with my friends.


It was a very cold and cloudy day so we decided to play indoor games.
 In the evening I asked my father and mother to go visting my uncls and hunty. 
My father told me that to take care of my self after that i went.
This is short story about my summer......................
